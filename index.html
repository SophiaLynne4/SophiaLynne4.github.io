    <h4>Review</h4>
    <div class="review">
    <p>
      This is my favorite series ever. Obviously that why it's here. It's magical, fantastical, action-packed, bloody, funny. What more could you ask for?
    </p>
    <p>
      In these books Marissa Meyer revisits classic fairytales, and makes them fresh, new, and completely different while honoring the originals. Cinder of course is Cinderella, Scarlet is Little Red Riding Hood, Cress is Rapunzel, and Winter is Snow White.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way she writes is so captivating. One of the books is over 800 pages, and I don't think I put it down once. It draws you in, in everyway possible. I was reading while laying down one day and my heartrate was 125 if that tells you anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not enough people have read this book. So please read it.

    <h3>Heartless</h3>
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18584855-heartless"><img src="./assets/heartless.jpg" alt="Heartless" class="image"></a>
    <h4>Quote</h4>
    <p>
      To be <i>all</i> right implies an impossible phase. We hope for <i>mostly</i> right on the best of our days. <br>
      <i>-Marissa Meyer, Heartless</i>
    </p>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Catherine may be one of the most desired girls in Wonderland, and a favorite of the unmarried King of Hearts, but her interests lie elsewhere. A talented baker, all she wants is to open a shop with her best friend. But according to her mother, such a goal is unthinkable for the young woman who could be the next queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Cath meets Jest, the handsome and mysterious court joker. For the first time, she feels the pull of true attraction. At the risk of offending the king and infuriating her parents, she and Jest enter into an intense, secret courtship. Cath is determined to define her own destiny and fall in love on her terms. But in a land thriving with magic, madness, and monsters, fate has other plans.
    </p>
    <h4>Review</h4>
    <div class="review">
    <p>
      The summary of Heartless doesn't do it justice. It makes it sound like a love story, but it's really not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cath is such a relatable person (and not in a cringe way). She loves baking, eating, and sleeping. And she hates being told what to do and awkward situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has a dream to own her own bakery, but even though she comes from a rich family, nothing ever comes easy to her. With controling parents that want to rule her life, oh, and a giant bird that is attacking and killing people, it makes it a little more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the story of how the Red Queen came to be who she was, and let me tell you. It's heart-wrenching. Based off Alice in Wonderland with cameos from other stories, it comes together into a giant collage of childhood memories mixed with a little bit of gore.

      Welcome, welcome to Caraval! The grandest show on land or by sea. Inside you’ll experience more wonders than most people see in a lifetime. You can sip magic from a cup and buy dreams in a bottle. But before you fully enter into our world, you must remember it’s all a game. <br>
      <i>-Stephanie Garber, Caraval</i>
    </p>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      A legendary competition. <br>
      A mesmerizing romance.<br>
      An unbreakable bond between two sisters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scarlett Dragna has never left the tiny island where she and her sister, Tella, live with their powerful, and cruel, father. Now Scarlett’s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval—the faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show—are over.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this year, Scarlett’s long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only, as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval’s mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season’s Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. Nevertheless she becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic. And whether Caraval is real or not, Scarlett must find Tella before the five nights of the game are over or a dangerous domino effect of consequences will be set off, and her beloved sister will disappear forever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Welcome, welcome to Caraval . . . beware of getting swept too far away.
    </p>
    <h4>Review</h4>
    <div class="review">
    <p>
      Caraval feels like a dream. For me and for the characters in the book probably. But I love this book because of how magical it is. Even though peoples lives are at risk it still somehow feels like a comforting book to me.... Is that weird?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the reasons I love this book is because it's about sisters. I always love anything about sisters becase my sister is my best friend so we can always relate. There's always one sister getting into all the trouble, while the other one has to save them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This story had so many twists and turns I was doubting myself every other page. Stephanie Garber did such a good job of making things confusing, but in a good way. Like you literally never knew if something was real or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      And real quick just gotta mention the cover art because I love it.

    <h3>The Book Thief</h3>
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19063.The_Book_Thief"><img src="./assets/the_book_thief.jpg" alt="The Book Thief" class="image"></a>
    <h4>Quote</h4>
    <p>
      Usually we walk around constantly believing ourselves. "I'm okay" we say. "I'm alright". But sometimes the truth arrives on you and you can't get it off. That's when you realize that sometimes it isn't even an answer--it's a question. Even now, I wonder how much of my life is convinced. <br>
      <i>-Markus Zusak, The Book Thief</i>
    </p>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will be busier still.
    </p>
    <p>
      By her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these are dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up, and closed down.
    <h4>Review</h4>
    <div class="review">
    <p>
      I think this is the first book I ever fell in love with. The way it's written feels like it's special and important. It makes me feel like I'm reading something I shouldn't be able to understand. I don't know if that makes any sense, but I guess I mean it's ahead of it's time
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a Holocaust book, but what I think makes it stand out is that it's centered around a family who hides a jew, but it's narrated by the Angel of Death. You wouldn't expect this to be a funny book after hearing that, but it's actually really funny. My favorite books are the ones that make you feel all the emotions, and this is one of those books for sure. One minute something tragic is happening, but then one second later the narrator is saying something stupidly hilarious.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book is just so well written, it's definitely going to be a classic some day.

    <h3>Anxious People</h3>
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49127718-anxious-people"> <img src="./assets/anxious_people.jpeg" alt="Anxious People" class="image"></a>
    <h4>Quote</h4>
    <p>
      This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiots. So it needs saying from the outset that it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is. <br>
      <i>-Fredrik Backman, Anxious People</i>
    </p>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Looking at real estate isn't usually a life-or-death situation, but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage. The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can't fix up their own marriage. There's a wealthy banker who has been too busy making money to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can't seem to agree on anything, from where they want to live to how they met in the first place. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment's only bathroom, and you've got the worst group of hostages in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them—the bank robber included—desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises, these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in a motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next.
    </p>
    <h4>Review</h4>
    <div class="review">
      <p>
        This book is a rollercoaster of emotion. It is so clever and witty and the humor is just on point. You can't read a book more relatable than one by Fredrik Backman.
      </p>
      <p>
        After reading one book by Fredrik Backman I think every character I ever read about again will seem two-dimensional. He has such a way of making these characters that are EXACTLY like actual humans. I feel like that rarely happens. I've never read a book by an author that was better at writing characters than him.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that's the thing. His characters are so good, because nothing ever really happens in this book. I mean yeah it's about a hostage situation, but they're all pretty much in the same room the whole time. This definitely isn't an action-packed book. And I'm not saying this in a bad way. He still manages to make it not boring.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a perfect blend of "actual tears of laughter" and "wow I relate to this so hard, how has this book explain human life so exactly".

    <h3>Earthbound</h3>
    <img src="./assets/earthbound.jpg" alt="Earthbound" class="image">
      <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
          Earthbound is the second game in the Mother seires comprised of Earthbound Zero, Earthbound, and Earthbound II (Mother, Mother II, and Mother III in Japan) In the second title, a child named Ness and his neighbor Porky Minch go to examine a meteor that crashed near their town. When they find it, a bug with time travel powers named Buzz Buzz tells Ness that he must gather three others on a quest to save the world from being destroyed by Giygas.
        </p>
      <h4>Review</h4>
      <div class="review">
        <p>
          Earthbound is such a joy. It's got everything. Zombies, aliens, cults, gangs, murder. After that list I'm finding it hard to justify this being such a comforting game to me. What can I say, it's a vibe. I want to play this year every single year for the rest of my life. I really don't think I would ever get sick of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love story games. And especially the ones where you can just roam around and do stuff in whatever order you like. I'm pretty sure there's a name for that but I can't remember. Can you tell I'm not a gamer? But this game is one of those games. You can do it however you like. You can do the bare minimum and barely win, or you can go above and beyond and COMPLETELY ANNIHILATE GIYGAS. So yeah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something else that I really love is that the characters are so good. They really are all their own person and have their own personalities. They also have actual names, but in the game, you get to name them whatever you want. You even get to name the dog even though you only ever see it like 3 times. It's super fun and cute though.

    <h3>Animal Crossing</h3>
    <img src="./assets/animal-crossing.jpg" alt="animal crossing" class="image">
    <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        In New Horizons, the player controls a character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, playing the game in a nonlinear fashion and developing the island as they choose. They can gather and craft items, customize the island, and develop it into a community of anthropomorphic animals.
      </p>
    <h4>Review</h4>
    <div class="review">
      <p>
        Everyone knows Animal Crossing. It's one of those games where you play it for 6 months everyday religiously, then you forget to one day, and then you forget to everyday after that for another 6 months. It's like that best friend you never see but when you do it's like they were never gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love so much about this game. I like how you can make your island anything you want. I love the villagers (or at least most of them), I love how interactive it is. You're never REALLY done on your island. There's always more to do. And while in real life that is an overwhelming thing to think about, in the game it's fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do think this game is a little overdue for an update. I'm glad one's happening soon. I was beginning to feel like it was a little monotonous. But I'm hoping these changes will fix that.

        BEAUTIFUL game. It is one of the most beautiful video games probably. I'm not a video game expert though so don't hold me to that. This game is so open and expansive it actually feels like you're going somewhere and experiencing things in a way. Also the soundtrack. I still get that opening song in my head randomly. The story is good, the animation is good, the fact that it's 3D is sick, and yeah. I just loved playing this game. It was a lot of fun.

    <h3>Zelda</h3>
    <img src="./assets/zelda.jpg" alt="Zelda" class="image">
    <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        100 years before the main events of the game, the Calamity Ganon returned, controlled the Guardiens and indirectly killed the legendary four Champions as well the King of Hyrule. Link was also badly wounded, while protecting Princess Zelda from Guardiens, and put into the Shrine of Life by Zelda. After an 100 year sleep, Links awoke with no memories of what happened 100 years ago. Shortly after that the spirit of the King of Hyrule tells Link what happened before and during his sleep. He must then go to the people, the 4 Champions belonged to, and into the four Titans, great machines which was controlled by the Champions. There in order to free the spirit of the Champions (Mipha, Daruk, Revali and Urbosa) he must defeat the corresponding 4 brights, that killed the 4 Champions long ago. There he also learns more about the Champions and what relationship Link had with them. In the end he needs to go to Castle Hyrule to Battle Calamity Ganon and to rescue Zelda, who stayed there all the years, to keep Ganon's powers at bay.

    <h4>Review</h4>
    <div class="review">
      <p>
        How was this animated so well that I actually felt like I was outside? That's suspicious. The beautiful landscapes mixed with their beautiful soundtrack was such a vibe. I liked how you would just be walking around peaceful and relaxed, then a monster comes up behind you screeching and the mood is completely ruined. It was honestly kind of funny.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing that was funny was that everytime there was a flashback (and there were a lot of them) they would mention how this horrible thing with Ganon happened 100 years ago. In one sentence they would be like, "One hundred years ago when Ganon attacked our kingdom 100 years ago it killed or 4 Champions. They died 100 years ago. You were asleep for 100 years because you were hurt in the battle 100 years ago." I mean I exaggerated a tiny bit. But way less than you can imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I don't know what I'm talking about anymore. This was a great game. I loved it. That's why it's here.

    <h3>Undertale</h3>
    <img src="./assets/undertale.jpg" alt="Undertale" class="image">
    <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        The player controls a child who has fallen into the Underground: a large, secluded region under the surface of the Earth, separated by a magical barrier. The player meets various monsters during the journey back to the surface, although some monsters might engage the player in a fight. The combat system involves the player navigating through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent. They can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of killing them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes.
      </p>
    <h4>Review</h4>
    <div class="review">
      <p>
        Games really are what you make it. Me and my brother do this thing whenever we play video games and there's dialog we give each character a different voice. Papyrus ended up sounding like Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove, at least that's kinda what I was going for. Let me tell you. Papyrus has a lot more monolouges than you think. That voice hurts after a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this game is so captivating. Once we started I really didn't want to get off. I like how you can choose what kind of person you're going to be. You can kill everyone, or you can spare everyone. There are different routes you can take. I think that makes it really fun to play the game over and over.
